Step into the **The Climb Within**, a _roguelike card game_ where every decision shapes your journey through the ever-shifting towers of emotions.

Ascend floors filled with challenges inspired by primal feelings — *joy, fear, anger, and more* — each introducing unique cards and mechanics. Craft a deck that balances the ephemeral and the enduring as you strive to overcome emotional trials, unlock hidden strengths, and achieve **personal growth**.

With every climb, you will evolve, reflecting your choices and progress, culminating in a quest to master the art of self-improvement and reach the pinnacle of inner peace.
